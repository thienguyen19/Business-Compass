                        <!-- I operate a business that specializes in selling bananas. Our operational expenses consist of employee salaries, which amount to $100,000 per person, and we currently employ 10 individuals. Additionally, we incur an annual cost of $8,000 for fan and air conditioning systems. Furthermore, the total cost associated with growing, processing, and packaging a single banana is $0.50, and the cost to deliver one banana is $1. To determine the selling price required to break even in the second year, we need to calculate our total costs and then divide by the number of bananas we anticipate selling. -->

                        <!-- First, let's calculate the total annual expenses, which include employee salaries ($100,000 x 10 = $1,000,000) and the cost of fan and air conditioning systems ($8,000), resulting in total annual expenses of $1,008,000. Now, let's examine the cost per banana, comprising the production and packaging cost of one banana at $0.50 and the delivery cost of $1.00, adding up to a total cost per banana of $1.50. To determine the number of bananas needed to break even in the second year, divide the total annual expenses by the cost per banana: $1,008,000 (Total Annual Expenses) divided by $1.50 (Cost per Banana) equals approximately 672,000 bananas. Therefore, you would need to sell around 672,000 bananas at a price equal to or greater than $1.50 each in the second year to achieve a break-even point. -->
